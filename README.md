# Symphony BDK for Python

This is the Symphony BDK for Python to help develop bots and interact with the [Symphony REST APIs](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference).

## Project Overview

Symphony BDK for Python provides tools for building bots and integrating with Symphony APIs. This document outlines its usage, installation, and contribution guidelines.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Build from Source
- Install dependencies: `poetry install`
- Build the package: `poetry build`
- Run tests: `poetry run pytest`
- Perform a pylint scan locally: `poetry run pylint <module_name>`
- Generate documentation locally: `cd docsrc && make html`

### Verification
Verify the successful installation by running any of the following commands:
```
poetry --version
```

## External Documents

Refer to the following for additional guidance:
- [Reference Documentation](https://symphony-bdk-python.finos.org/)
- [Getting Started Guide](https://symphony-bdk-python.finos.org/markdown/getting_started.html)

### Updating Generated Code

Python BDK uses [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) to generate code. 
To update the generated code, follow these steps:

1. Checkout the latest branch of the fork (e.g., [sym-python-5.5.0](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0)).
2. Update the fork source code, review, and merge it.
3. Generate the JAR file in `openapi-generatormodules/openapi-generator-cli/target/openapi-generator-cli.jar`:
   - Use Maven: 
     ```bash
     mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true && mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
     ```
   - Alternatively, use IntelliJ's build button to build the project and generate the JAR file.
4. Copy the JAR file to the Python BDK repository: `symphony-api-client-python/api_client_generation/openapi-generator-cli.jar`.
5. Execute the generation script: 
   ```bash
   ./generate.sh
   ```
6. Commit and push the newly generated code along with the updated JAR file.
